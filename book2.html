        <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
            Diving into the early ages of adolescence, which are linked to severe distress, functional impairment, or self-harm risk, have you ever considered how sports engagement could counteract or avoid that? 
<br> the recent society, many young people struggle with mental health challenges that may not be well understood by their parents, teachers or caregivers. Engaging in team sports can provide an outlet, for children dealing with illnesses to cope with stress, anger and sadness by channeling these feelings into their practice and competitive play. According to Hansen et al. (2010), it is possible to learn how to manage both negative emotions that arise during physical activities or when working towards a goal through various pursuits, like sports.
        </p>
        <p><b>Thesis</b><br>
            The mental health issues among youth due to various factors such as education, family, relationships, community exposed to, etc. is drastically increasing, posing impact in their life, where they aren’t aware of curbing it. Sports is one of the best, youth-friendly ways to reduce the mental health issues.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Rise of Mental Illness</b><br>
            An important element of growth and health in adolescence is mental health. Yadeun-Antuñano’s (2019) definition of mental health is “the state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her capabilities, can cope with normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute towards his or her community.”
Although mental health is a fundamental unit of development, mental disorders occur at concerning levels among the youth. Mental health gradually starts declining due to various factors such as intense exposure to pressure and stress, harsh parenting, rejection and discrimination, depression and anxiety that lead to suicide, behavioral disorders that may lead to criminal behavior, anorexia nervosa leading to premature death, and mainly, media influence (World Health Organization, 2021b).
To pacify it down through global health programs such as AAH-HA! focus on mental disorders like depressive disorders, and childhood behavioral disorders (World Health Organization, 2017).
        </p>
        <p><b>Impact of Psychotropic Medication on Teens</b><br>
            However, drugs are prescribed for the cure of mental disorders, even for children. Leeder (2001) says that children aren't just a smaller version of adults, but they're distinct groups within their unique characteristics. As they grow, their bodies change, affecting the results of the medications prescribed, and hence, their medication needs to be tailored accordingly. 
Stimulants like Ritalin can dampen the brain’s receptors and as a result, expose it to the risk of substance abuse later in life (Vitiello, 2001). In the words of Spetie and Arnold (2007), Phenobarbital can cause permanent negative effects on cognition and SSRIs have been linked to irritability, shivering, agitation, hypotonia, and pulmonary hypertension in newborns.
        </p>
        <p><b>Sports and Mental Health</b><br>
            Physical activity benefits mood conditions like depression, anxiety, stress, and self-esteem in an individual. Hence, an improvement in psychological well-being is one way through which physical activity has the potential to prevent suicidality (Taliaferro et al., 2008).
Gisladottir et al., (2013) looked into the relationships between the adolescent's sports club participation. A total of 10987 students (aged 14-16) from Iceland were tested regarding their health and behavior. The survey consisted of 59 questions on 22 pages which revealed that the students who practiced sports possessed better physical health and positive body image than those who almost didn't practice any sports. Additionally, participants who practiced sports were more optimistic about their future than those who didn't practice any. They believed they would have better incomes in the future evincing that this batch of young people have more confidence in their lives than the people who practice sports less. It proves Valgeirsson's (1990) point that participation in sports affects adolescents' confidence and self-esteem.<br>
Another research depicts the relative risk of suicidality with sports participation. 13,857 students of Grades 9-12 were made to do a 2005 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the data. Of 13,857 students, 16.9% had considered attempting suicide, 13.3% had suicide plans, 9% had attempted suicide 4.2% attempted suicide many times. The study revealed that male athletes experience low rates of suicidality and hopelessness due to sports (Guarin & Jhon, 2018). <br>
Steiner et al., (2000) noted that all the results of sports may not be beneficial. Researchers address that a root of potential negative impact could be the coaches (Guarin & Jhon, 2018). Suppose, coaches cause their players to stress over physical body image, which likely results in the player adopting an eating disorder.<br>
The research intends to prove sports are liberally associated with good mental health. The first research proved sports help boost confidence in adolescents' lives which is a carry-off for their futures. The second one verifies that sports relatively decrease suicide rate and hopelessness amongst the youths.<br>
An example of a famous athlete who went through anxiety, ADHD, and emotional abuse from her coach, is Laurie Hernandez. Despite her low mental health at a young age, she continued to practice and perform flawlessly, winning medals after medals. She is a pride of motivation for teens going through harsh moments in life.
        </p>
        <p><b>Discussion</b><br>
            In this research, the effects of sports on the mental health of youths have been discussed. Altogether, it is possible to state the effects of sports from the perspective of boosting self-esteem and the promotion of lifestyle health as well as the eradication of depression and suicides. As the review shows, the following conclusions can be stated: Young people are sensitive to their image and are more likely to think positively while exercising and understand the role of exercise in their lifestyle health. In addition, this paper will establish that physical activity and sports can help reduce depression.
